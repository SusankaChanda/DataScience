# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Overview
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a critical task in the financial industry to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing various transaction attributes.

# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem, costing billions of dollars each year. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a fraud detection system. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to create a reliable system for identifying fraudulent transactions.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rakesh3117/TechnoHacks/tree/main/credit-card-fruad-detection

## Usage

Prepare your dataset or use the provided dataset in the data directory.

Preprocess the data, extract features, and prepare it for training. You can find example data preprocessing scripts in the data_preprocessing directory.

Train the fraud detection model using the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the model_training directory.

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

Deploy the model in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.

# Data
The data used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes historical credit card transactions, with labels indicating whether each transaction was fraudulent or not.

# Model
The machine learning model used for credit card fraud detection can vary, but common approaches include logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks. The trained model can be found in the models directory.

# Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The evaluation code can be found in the evaluation directory.
