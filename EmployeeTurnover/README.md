### Employee Turnover Prediction

### Overview

Employee turnover prediction is a crucial task for organizations to identify employees who are likely to leave the company. This project uses machine learning to develop a predictive model for employee turnover.

### Introduction

High employee turnover can be costly and disruptive for companies. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict which employees are at risk of leaving the organization. By identifying potential turnover risks, organizations can take proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rakesh3117/TechnoHacks/tree/main/Employee-turnover

### Usage

Prepare your employee turnover dataset or use the provided dataset in the data directory.

Preprocess the data, extract features, and prepare it for model training. You can find example data preprocessing scripts in the data_preprocessing directory.

Train the employee turnover prediction model using the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the model_training directory.

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deploy the model in a production environment to predict employee turnover.

### Data
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes historical employee data with labels indicating whether each employee left the company or not.

### Model
The machine learning model used for employee turnover prediction can vary, but common approaches include logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests. The trained model can be found in the models directory.

### Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualizations. The evaluation code can be found in the evaluation directory.
